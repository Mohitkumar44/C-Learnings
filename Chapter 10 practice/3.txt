Hi, I'm Mohit Kumar, a student currently pursuing my B.Tech at REC Banda. I completed my JEE exams, scoring 89.2 percentile in JEE Mains and 63 in JEE Advanced. I also do a B.Sc. alongside my B.Tech studies. I have a strong interest in programming, and I've already learned Python and C, with plans to explore C++, Java, and SQL. I have a keen interest in web development and am looking forward to diving deeper into it. In my free time, I enjoy exploring tech and editing content.
